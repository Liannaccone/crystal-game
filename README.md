### About the Author

My name is Luke Iannaccone and I am a software engineer. I grew up in New Jersey and graduated from Georgetown University in 2014 with a BS in Healthcare Management and Policy. For the past three years, I worked at Triage Consulting Group as a Senior Associate leading teams of consultants providing payer strategy and revenue cycle consulting services to health systems throughout the country. The technical skills I gained analyzing and managing disparate healthcare data sets (using SQL) led me to seek out a career in software development. 

I am currently attending UC Berkeley's Coding School and am exploring opportunities as a full-time software developer. Feel free to reach out to me at Lciannaccone@gmail.com. Thank you!
